You know those fields with drop-down lists? Well, the idea of this
plugin is to use the db for handling those kinds of lists -- rather
than having those lists stored in view or helper code or even yaml 
files.

Just kidding. But not really. Point is, this code sucks. Breaks pretty 
much every unwritten rule of proper Rails coding. I won't bore you 
with the details.

Don't bother looking in the code. As I said, it sucks.

So why post it on github? Because I couldn't figure out how to manage
this code using git with the shared codebase sitting on my local 
machine while still using capistrano to deploy. github is a no-brainer.

Someday, when this plugin code becomes beautiful, I'll write up a
proper README. But for now, just move along. :)
